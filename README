These codes are working on python versions 3.10 and above

NOTE : Some codes are taken from sample codes given by sir and I got to know about subprocess calls from the internet

Instructions to run:
1. first open wsl (windows system linux or ubuntu terminal on your machine)

3. Run : python3 Send.py -s localhost -d -p 7777 -n 400 -l 512 -r 100 -w 3 -f 10
 

NOTE : Since I used python , this does not require a make file
